# BassLive Engine

The new BassLive engine running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) together with [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)!

The BassLive [app](https://github.com/bassjansson/basslive-app) uses this engine.

## Acknowledgements

The engine is inspired by and partly based on [node-core-audio](https://github.com/AudioNet/node-core-audio) by [Mike Vegeto](https://github.com/ZECTBynmo).
